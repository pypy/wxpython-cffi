"""
Demo of a FloatCanvas App that will create an image, without
actually showing anything on screen. It seems to work, but you do need
to have an X-server running on *nix for this to work.

Note: you need to specify the size in the FloatCanvas Constructor.

hmm -- I wonder if you'd even need the frame?
